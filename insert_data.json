        "description": "The defining, behind-the-scenes chronicle of one of the most extraordinary, beloved, and dominant pop cultural entities in America\u2019s history -- Marvel Comics \u2013 and the outsized personalities who made Marvel including Martin Goodman, Stan Lee, and Jack Kirby.&#xa0;&#xa0;<br /><br />\u201cSean Howe\u2019s history of Marvel makes a compulsively readable, riotous and heartbreaking version of my favorite story, that of how a bunch of weirdoes changed the world\u2026That it\u2019s all true is just frosting on the cake.\u201d&#xa0; \u2014Jonathan Lethem<br /><br />For the first time,&#xa0;Marvel Comics&#xa0;tells the stories of the men who made Marvel: Martin Goodman, the self-made publisher who forayed into comics after a get-rich-quick tip in 1939, Stan Lee, the energetic editor who would shepherd the company through thick and thin for decades and Jack Kirby, the WWII veteran who would co-create Captain America in 1940 and, twenty years later, developed with Lee the bulk of the company\u2019s marquee characters in a three-year frenzy. Incorporating more than one hundred original interviews with those who worked behind the scenes at Marvel over a seventy-year-span,&#xa0;Marvel Comics&#xa0;packs anecdotes and analysis into a gripping narrative of how a small group of people on the cusp of failure created one of the most&#xa0;enduring pop cultural forces in contemporary America."
