Harry and his friends spend their third year learning how to handle a half-horse half-eagle Hippogriff, repel shape-shifting Boggarts and master the art of Divination. They also visit the wizarding village of Hogsmeade and the Shrieking Shack, which is considered the most haunted building in Britain. In addition to these new experiences, Harry must overcome the threats of the soul-sucking Dementors, outsmart a dangerous werewolf and finally deal with the truth about Sirius Black and his relationship to Harry and his parents. With his best friends, Harry masters advanced magic, crosses the barriers of time and changes the course of more than one life. Directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and based on J.K. Rowling's third book, this wondrous spellbinder soars with laughs, and the kind of breathless surprise only found in a Harry Potter adventure.",

And to hear her tell it, Kathryn Tucker Windham owes it all to her father, the small-town banker, school-board chairman, and Sunday school superintendent who always came home with a story. These stories celebrate the father he was and the stories that are his legacy. Moving from vignette to story, Mrs. Windham remembers:<br /> Her father's Panama hat Greeting her father as he returned from business trips, bringing her gifts of new books Learning to speak French And more colorful memories of a remarkable relationship<br />Lovingly, her father instilled in his daughter the gifts of keen observation and a facility for language that reward Ms. Windham's listeners with a unique story experience."

Maas brings her sexy, action-packed series to new heights.<br />Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. Though she\u2019s now been granted the powers and lifespan of the High Fae,<br />she is haunted by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she performed to save the lives of Tamlin and his people.<br /> As her marriage to Tamlin approaches, Feyre\u2019s hollowness and nightmares consume her. She finds herself split into two different people: one who upholds<br />her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court, and one who lives out her life in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While Feyre navigates a dark web of<br />politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms. She might just be the key to stopping it, but only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her<br />fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future\u2014and the future of a world in turmoil."

Einaudi's unique musical language melds classical compositional technique with influences from rock, folk, pop, and other genres to create a wide and daring embrace of style and form. As these 12 pieces\u2014at turns joyful, melancholic, and ruminative\u2014unfold, we get to witness one of music\u2019s most game-changing artists in a rare environment, simultaneously onstage and in his studio, where, amid his piano, desk, books, cameras, and other tools, new forms of expression are constantly taking root. Backdropped by vivid, thought-provoking visuals, Einaudi, cellist Redi Hasa, and violinist/violist Federico Mecozzi mix pieces from the composer's concert repertoire\u2014taken from albums including Elegy for the Arctic, Elements, and 2019\u2019s Seven Days Walking series\u2014with others played for the very first time: \u201cThere is a balance between moments of \u2018search' and others where the music flows with more definition,\u201d Einaudi says of the work\u2019s exploratory instincts. \u201cIt's a creative space where your mind can still wander.\u201d"
